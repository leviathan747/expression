expression
==========

Command line utility to evaluate arithmetic expressions. This tool supports
positive and negative integer and real values written in simple decimal
notation (scientific notation and based literals are not supported). Due to
reserved characters in BASH, `x` is used for multiplication, `^` is used for
power, and `[`/`]` are used for parentheses.

Supported operators:

|   |                |
|---|----------------|
| + | addition       |
| - | subtraction    |
| x | multiplication |
| / | devision       |
| % | modulus        |
| ^ | power          |
